DerPy is a minimalist, low-to-no dependency website construction framework. It
runs on Apache/mod_wsgi, and it may or may not support more platforms in the 
future. Documentation is currently non-existant, though you can find a lot of 
information in the commit messages; I'll write some up if anyone expresses 
interest.

I'm writing this as a basis for an assignment and a few personal projects. Its 
basic structure is based on shish's Shimmie2 (more specifically SCore): 
Extensions (Event Listeners) do everything; the only significant structures 
other than Extensions are for initialization, coordination and database access. 
The only major departure from the Shimmie model is concurrency, and that's only 
because it's forced upon us by WSGI.

(Why's it called DerPy? This is my first real experience with Python, so there 
will likely be lots of derp.)

**This is not in a usable state yet** : The database engine doesn't do 
anything, and no events are generated.
